# 10 Attributes That Make a Job Resilient to AI Displacement

## The Original Defenses: Why AI Can't Take Over

**1. Physical presence and dexterity required**
Robots and AI still struggle enormously with unstructured physical environments — a plumber navigating a unique crawl space or a surgeon making tactile judgments represents what Andrew Ng calls the "hardware bottleneck" that software alone can't solve. Crucially, as AI accelerates design, planning, and remote work, the bottleneck shifts to the people who show up in person to execute — meaning skilled trades and hands-on roles may see demand surge, not shrink.

**2. Trust is the core product, not information**
When people hire a therapist, financial advisor, or doctor, they're buying a relationship and confidence in a human who is accountable to them — something Yann LeCun argues AI cannot replicate because trust is fundamentally social. As AI makes these services cheaper to deliver at scale, the addressable market expands dramatically, growing demand for the human workers at the center of those relationships.

**3. Novel, ambiguous judgment in high-stakes situations**
François Chollet's core critique of LLMs is that they pattern-match on training data rather than reason from first principles — so jobs requiring genuine judgment in genuinely new situations (crisis negotiators, ER physicians, investigative journalists) remain hard to automate. These roles also become more valuable as AI handles routine cases and escalates only the genuinely hard ones to humans.

**4. Legal or ethical accountability**
Some roles exist precisely because a human must be *liable* — a licensed engineer who stamps a drawing, a CFO who signs financials, a judge who renders a verdict. As AI takes on more execution, the demand for humans who can be *responsible* for that output — auditors, compliance officers, AI oversight roles — is likely to grow, not shrink.

**5. Deep contextual knowledge built over time within a specific organization**
Andrew Ng has noted that the hardest thing to replicate isn't general intelligence but accumulated institutional knowledge — the senior employee who knows why a decision was made 8 years ago and who to call to fix it. This knowledge also makes these workers uniquely valuable as AI system managers: they know what good output looks like and when to override it.

**6. Political and interpersonal navigation**
Organizational life runs on coalition-building, reading the room, managing egos, and negotiating competing agendas — skills that require real-time human social intelligence that AI observes poorly and executes not at all. As AI automates more individual tasks, the coordination and change management required to deploy it effectively makes these skills *more* valuable, not less.

**7. Creative work with a genuine point of view**
AI can produce competent, average creative output at scale, but work that reflects a distinct human perspective, aesthetic risk, or cultural embeddedness — an auteur filmmaker, an architect with a philosophy — is harder to displace because the *person* is part of the product. The proliferation of AI-generated content may also increase the market premium placed on work that is demonstrably, distinctively human.

**8. Work that requires being changed by the experience**
Teaching, mentorship, therapy, and caregiving often require someone who genuinely grows through the relationship — a teacher who learns from a struggling student and adapts is doing something fundamentally different from retrieval and instruction. As AI handles administrative burden and routine content delivery in these fields, human practitioners are freed to focus on exactly this irreplaceable dimension.

## The New Resilience: Jobs That Benefit From AI's Rise

**9. Roles where expertise has been underutilized due to administrative or volume constraints**
Doctors, lawyers, engineers, and analysts spend large portions of their day on tasks well below their skill ceiling — documentation, research retrieval, routine communication, data gathering. Andrew Ng's core argument is that AI automates tasks, not jobs, and when those below-ceiling tasks compress, these workers don't become redundant — they become significantly more productive and valuable. The physician who gets back 40% of their day from administrative work is not replaced; they see more patients, make better decisions, and deliver more value. This is the clearest mechanism by which AI actively *benefits* high-expertise roles.

**10. Roles that sit downstream of current bottlenecks — or that manage AI systems themselves**
When AI clears a bottleneck in one part of a workflow, demand surges for roles on the other side of it. If drug discovery accelerates, clinical trial coordinators and regulatory specialists expand. If legal document review speeds up, the litigation work it feeds grows. If financial planning becomes cheaper to deliver, millions of new customers enter the market and the industry grows. Separately, every organization deploying AI agents needs people with domain expertise who can evaluate outputs, catch failures, and decide when to override — roles Jensen Huang describes as "HR for AI." Workers who deeply understand what good work looks like in their field are best positioned to fill both of these expanding categories.

*The common thread: AI excels at well-defined tasks with clear inputs and outputs. The jobs that hold up — and in many cases grow — are those where task boundaries are fuzzy, the stakes of failure are high, the human being there is inseparable from the value delivered, or where the worker's expertise is what directs and validates the AI doing work around them. — Synthesized from Andrew Ng, Yann LeCun, François Chollet, Jensen Huang, Satya Nadella, and Daron Acemoglu*
